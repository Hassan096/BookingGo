This project was done in Eclipse (Neon.3 Release (4.6.3)). To run JSON parser, JSONSimple JARs need to be added to the project.
The first two arguments are that of pickup and drop-off location and the third argument is of the number of Passengers.
The result is displayed as Parsed JSON taking into account the number of passengers and the cheapest option per supplier per taxi type.
